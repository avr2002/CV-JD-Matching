Accomplishments
When I first started to work for Boost Mobile I didn't know a thing about sales or phones at all. I was so insecure about everything, until one day I
decided to put all the insecurity thoughts aside and show my true strength and confidence. My sale skills went from zero to none to one hundred.
My best day is when I sold 31 phones in one day with accessories, I was so proud about how hard I work to get to my goal. I have a lot of thanks
to my coworkers because they showed me how to push myself to my highest limit and conquer my goals. They also showed me how to be a team
player and to always help everyone and not just customers. One of the best months was when I sold 145 phones and over $3,088 worth in
accessories. Routinely helped as many as ten customers each day in a high-volume retail outlet.I also fulfilled all supervisory duties when the store
manager was on vacation. I'm very proud on what I've learn over the couple of months working at Boost Mobile of Mobile Factory, I thank them
for helping me develop my skills and making me into the person I know I am.

English Language Arts Teacher Company Name ï¼​ City , State
I have worked at Lakes High School in the Clover Park School District for the past five years. In my time at Lakes, I have taught 9th grade, 11th
grade and 12th grade English as well as AP Literature and AP Language. Due to some teacher turnover and the adapting needs of the English
department, I have had the opportunity to build my experience across grade levels and develop curriculum after curriculum to suit the needs of
students at various ages. As a result, I believe one of my greatest strengths is my understanding of the skills necessary at each grade level for
students to successfully exist high school career or college-ready.

Personal Information
Lakeland College Kirtland, OH, United States Although it is not a degree for the culinary field, I have been able to apply this degree to my career
and it has helped me along in my career obtain various management positions within the culinary field, which I have excelled in in my nine plus years
of this profession. My goal is to one day become an executive chef and I feel at this point I will reach it one day soon. Cooking has become a
strong passion of mine to where cooking jobs do not feel like jobs anymore, its more like a fun way to live my life day to day able to wake up
excited to go learn new cooking skills and make people excited about visiting our restaurant, well which ever one I am working in at the time. High
School Diploma: Culinary Arts (Vocational School at Beechwood High School) 2005 Charles F Brush Lyndhurst, OH, United States While
attending Brush High School (My high School) I also attended Beechwood High School from my Junior year (11th Grade) to my senior Year
(12th Grade) to study culinary arts where we learned the basics of cooking. I was interested in how to become a cook and how to make various
dishes so I would e able to cook meals for my family at home. During high school, although I was in the Culinary Arts program, at the time it did
not keep my interest, so when I graduated I got into the Business management field, while attending college I began working as a dishwasher at
Houlihans and was intrigued again by working in the kitchen, so much that I was able to be promoted to prep cook and from there I started my
Culinary Career. Each year they have it here in Cleveland, and if I am Available, I work at our annual Air show as a cook vendor if there is an
opportunity for me. I also like to volunteer to cook for the homeless at our Cleveland Food Bank, during the holidays which I have not been able
to do recently, but I do love being able to put smiles on everyone during the holidays with exceptional and delightful meals.",10889157,CHEF

Experience
Company Name City , State Sushi Chef 10/2014 to Current
Working at Wasabi's Downtown entailed the same tasks a sushi chef as Sushi Time, only I am now second chef instead of head chef. I feel like I
am again coming to the point where I would like a new opportunity to start from the bottom as I have done in the past at Sushi Time and The 5
Spot.
Company Name City , State Dishwasher/ Line Cook 04/2014 to 10/2014
Working at The 5 Spot was a really awesome experience for me. It provided some of the more conventional style kitchen and line cook
experience that I had not so much been exposed to at Sushi Time. I also started off at the dishwashing position here. Although I was only there for
a short period of time, the exposure to this type of kitchen environment was something that I had been missing in my culinary experience. It also
posed a challenge for me since I have been mostly making sushi for the better part of the last few years. The 5 Spot was a highly fast-paced
neighborhood kitchen. So, you had to be quick all around and good knife skills are a must. I really enjoyed the challenge of once again having to
start all over from the bottom and work my way back up. I ended up leaving The 5 Spot due to constant management changes and an offer to
work for my old boss again.
Company Name City , State Host, Server, Dishwasher, Cook 03/2008 to 03/2014
Sushi Time Towa is the first restaurant i have worked for. I have been employed by Sushi Time for six years where I started at the very bottom
and worked my way to the top. I have worked as a host and as a server which consisted of me greeting customers, helping them to their seats,
grabbing their drinks and orders and doing my best to give them the utmost service and keep a smile on their face. I worked as a host/server for
about a year, so most of my time has really been spent working in the kitchen and making sushi. In order for me to work my way up through the
ranks to sushi, I started at the very bottom in the dish pit. This consisted of me washing all dishes, pots, pans, and silverware. I was also required
to prep meats and veggies. Having started at the dish/prep position, these tasks really helped me build a strong work ethic and develop great knife
skills as well. I then moved over to cooking which consisted of still participating with prep work, but also cooking and frying all orders. Prep
consisted of cutting chicken, beef, shrimp, squid, and all types of veggies. I have been doing sushi now for 3 years. That is, Monday-Saturday 10-
10, give or take a few hours. I have had random days off here and there and some holidays, but for the most part 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.
I have developed such a passion for food and seeing a smile on a person's face when they bite into the food and love it. I love being in an
environment conducive for success and working hard while loving what I do. Being a sushi chef at Sushi Time consists of a wide range of tasks.
I've received serve safe managerial training, so I am in charge of making sure everything is clean and up to code. I'm also in charge of going over
inventory; ranging from paper/plastics, to all meats and veggies, also drinks and alcohol. This task also means I must handle all ordering trough the
different distributors and vendors we may use. My job requires me on a daily basis to: cook and marinate rice, cut and prepare fish for the day,
making sushi-rolls, nigiri, sashimi, platters etc. Im also required to assist customers sitting at the sushi bar with any inquiries or concerns they may
have. Over the course of the 6 years i have been employed by Towa, I have gained so much. Ive matured so much through this job and sushi really
has become such a passion of mine. I am a really hard worker who is also fun to work with, who is merely seeking a new opportunity to further my
skill set and continue doing what i love. I have a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. And I have no problem adjusting to any style or
training. I will work any days/nights or weekends and holidays if necessary.

Personal Information
I grew up on a farm in a small town of Superior, Pennsylvania. My early influences were all centered on food. My grandparents grew and sold
their own vegetables and meats. Dennis Turkey Farm was known for its customer satisfaction and â€˜clean farm' practices. I learned about
environmental stewardship from grandparents that farmed holistically. I fondly remember working with Grandpa Dennis, plucking turkey feathers
and processing chickens to fill the latest orders.Inside the farmhouse, I sat wide eyed watching my grandmother make what seemed like magic in
her big wooden bowl filling the orders for our family restaurant called Glisans .I credit my grandmother for instilling within me the passion for
savory and baking and using all of the chef senses! I have worked practically all of my life in some form within the hospitality world. I am very
creative, positive, warm, personable with strong attention to detail and management skills. I pride myselfon quality of work with a strong work
ethic. I pride myself on high customer satisfaction and client retention. I am a true leader and a fantastic administrator and teacher.

Personal Information
A 76th street, 07047 Dear Ms. Gina Lucia The adds you have posted on your website mactches my qualifications in graphic art. I have
remarkable skills in digital, and graphic arts, and I would make a great designer in, and out of the field. I've had much experience with graphic, and
digital art in High School, and posted my artwork on my website. This skill has taught me many things about creativity. When I make art in any
design I notice that I am creating life on a blank piece of paper. To me making art is bringing the creativity to life, and to also give it any kind of
emotions to it. I have worked with many people who had more experience then me, and have already started to work under you. If you speak to
them they can tell you more about my designs. I am a hard worker, and I will always do my best to get the job done. I hope this has given you the
thought of allowing me to work under you. Hopefully we will have a chance to speak in person next week. Thank you for your time, and
consideration. Sincerely, Ethan Araya Ethan Araya",18979238,DESIGNER

Accomplishments As part of one of my last core Communications classes at The University of Louisiana at Lafayette, better known as Campaigns 490, students
were divided into 5 teams of 5 to create a campaign for a specific client, the ULL Communication Department. The proposal was to increase
recruitment numbers by 20% in the next year. Each member of the team had a unique job and mine was Editor, which entailed reviewing,
proofreading, and finalizing the group's final written reports and social media sites. After a semester of gathering and analyzing research, developing
a campaign based on objectives, creating a new branded image and evaluating the plan for the department, the Department of Communication
chose our campaign as the winning group proposal

Started off as an Anthropology major with a minor in photography but soon found I loved my art classes just as much. Â At first glance they seem
unrelated but both deal with people and expressing the human condition. While one does it through studying actions and artifacts to better
understand different cultures and time periods, the other deals with feelings and views shown through art. They are different but together they are a
good combination for a more rounded point of view. Â Course work included animation, digital as well as traditional black and white
photography, web design, oil panting, sculpture, print media, art history, childhood psychology,Â Â ancient civilizations and modern culture.
